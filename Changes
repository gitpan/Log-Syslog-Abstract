Revision history for Log-Syslog-Abstract

1.101	Wed, 29 Sep 2010 14:15:48 -0400 
	(bugfix) Some Unix::Syslog constants may not exist on some platforms,
	even if they claim to be exportable by Unix/Syslog.pm.  This caused
	runtime crashes on Solaris -- but not during the tests, as we fake
	everything there.

1.100	Wed, 19 Mar 2008 17:16:30 -0400
	(enhancement) Now uses Sub::Exporter instead of plain old Exporter,
	mostly for the ability to rename methods at import-time.

1.002	Tue, 01 Apr 2008 10:38:24 -0400
	(bugfix) RHEL5 still ships with ancient Sys::Syslog.  Call
	setlogsock() to make it happy.

1.001	Tue, 06 Nov 2007 12:17:47 -0500 dmo

	(bugfix) Module would fail to load with older versions of Sys::Syslog
	that didn't support :macros

1.000	Fri, 13 Apr 2007 09:51:49 -0400 dmo
	First public version released to CPAN
